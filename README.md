# vtk_multiblockdataset_reader

This is pure Fortran code for reading vtk multiblock dataset (.vtm) files (only vtm file not the dataset files (model files)). It demonstrates reading a hierarchical tree from an XML file. So, this code can be slightly changed to use reading other hierarchical trees given by XML files of same format. It also demonstrates storing tree data with allocatable array but not with pointer (ie. linked list).

For reading XML file, xml-fortran of Arjen Marcus is a great source, which is very simple to learn (http://xml-fortran.sourceforge.net/). The basic part of the main module (module_multiblockdataset.f90) was generated by means of xmlreader of xml-fortran. Then it was chaged to be more object oriented style and added tree traversal subroutine. In addition, since xml-fortran uses Fortran 90, derived type arrays are generated as pointer, however since allocatable arrays are safer in terms of memory leak, derived type arrays were changed to allocatable.
